Hey, I'm Ryan. I'm a Laravel and JavaScript developer from the south-east of the United Kingdom.

I occasionally write [blog posts]() about web technologies. They normally cover interesting techniques that I use in my own applications, ways of improving your code base or weird and wacky things you can do with PHP and JavaScript.

I'm a big believer in open-source software &mdash; I've contributed to many open-source projects and even have [a few of my own on GitHub](https://github.com/ryangjchandler).
