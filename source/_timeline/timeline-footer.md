Pretty successful change. I added a footer to the site, along with a proper sitemap and RSS feed so that my **massive** number of followers and readers can hook that up to their RSS feed apps.

Today was also the day that I deployed this new timeline thing. I think it's a pretty nifty idea. I'd love to come back and do some sort of timeline-ception thing, but I can't be arsed right now. This is the best I've got.
