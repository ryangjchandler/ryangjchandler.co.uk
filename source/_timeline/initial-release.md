This was the initial version of my personal site. I wanted a super minimal design with barebones features. Looking back now, I should have added some more stuff and the launch wasn't the smoothest. I decided to change all of my DNS settings after announcing the first post. I disabled Cloudflare and relied 100% on Netlify's own DNS service. Could have been worse, to be honest.
