Pretty big milestone. The first 100 commits into the `ryangjchandler/ryangjchandler` repository. The 100th commit was a bit of a rip off since it was a merge commit. The pull request that got merged can be found [here](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/ryangjchandler/pull/24). It included some changes to the front page that changed the "Articles" to "Latest Articles" and added a new dedicated "Articles" page.

You might also notice the new excerpts / short text for each post. Think it's nice to have a sneak preview of what the article is about. These don't have much information, and in the future I might choose to add a dedicated excerpt which does a bit more explaining. This is fine for now.

I also changed the footer slightly. On desktop, it now sits inline and flat and then on mobile it will stack using the `.flex-col-reverse` class that Tailwind ever so kindly provides for situations such as this.

Here's what the new "Articles" page look like:
