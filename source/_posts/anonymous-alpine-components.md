How often do you _actually_ need a reactive UI for your website? I often find myself just attaching regular event listeners and doing something basic, like calling a function when a button is clicked. I don't always need the reactive, data driven features that modern frameworks provide.

Before Alpine came about, I'd attach these event listeners using an inline `<script>` tag and vanilla JavaScript. Since using Alpine more, I've actually enjoyed keeping that logic inside of the markup itself.

## But why?
