[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a command line tool for managing and versioning software. It was originally created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), who also created the Linux kernel, in 2005 and is now maintained by [Junio Hamano](https://twitter.com/jch2355).

Various other version control systems and software exists, but I can imagine Git is the most popular, especially with platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org).
