Don't worry, this isn't an April Fools Day post. It's a genuine article with a genuine quick tip.

Everytime I need to title something, whether it be a new article, page or sub-heading, I can never remember when I need to capitalise 'for', 'and', 'about', etc.

The other day I came across a nice little microservice site from the wonderful people at ZEIT. They have a site very aptly named [title.sh](title.sh). All you do is type your wanted title in the text box without any formatting and it will correctly capitalise the words according to [The Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/).
