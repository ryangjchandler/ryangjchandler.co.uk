This repository contains the source code for my personal site and blog. There will be constant changes in here as I experiment with new technologies and what not, so do not expect it to be stable 100% of the time.

Please do feel free to fork this repository and use it for your own site, or atleast as a starting point.

### Technology Stack

* Static site generation is powered by [Tighten's Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/)
* All front-end styles are done with Tailwind CSS (of course)
* There isn't any JavaScript on the site at the moment, but in the future I will be using [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) to level up on interactivity.

### Contributing

I've got issues closed currently since I don't need them for anything. If you spot a problem, hit me up on [Twitter @ryangjchandler](https://twitter.com/ryangjchandler) instead!

If you're feeling really cool and rebellious, fork the repo and throw in a PR. Why the hell not?
